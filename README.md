# Super Mario

Mario Clone Game (C++)
This is a simple Mario clone built using C++ that follows best programming practices and design patterns to ensure clean and maintainable code. The game features classic Mario gameplay elements, including walking, jumping, ducking, stopping, and shooting apples at the enemy. The character can collide with enemies and lose a life or shoot at them to increase the score.

## Gameplay

- **Walk**: Use the 'D' key to move Mario to the right and the 'A' key to move Mario to the left.
- **Jump**: Press the 'W' key to make Mario jump.
- **Duck**: Hold the 'S' key to make Mario duck and avoid obstacles.
- **Stop**: Press the 'a' to stop
- **Shoot**: Press the 'Space' key to make Mario shoot apples to eliminate enemies.
- **Quit**: Press the 'Esc' key at any time to exit the game.

## Project Overview

The 'Super Mario' game is developed with a focus on creating a well-organized, modular, and extensible codebase. The implementation of advanced OOP principles ensures a scalable architecture, allowing for seamless updates and additions to the game's features.

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles

The project adheres to the following key OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Classes and objects are used to encapsulate game entities, behaviors, and functionalities, promoting clean code organization.

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is leveraged to create a hierarchy of game elements, allowing for code reuse and specialization.

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphic behavior is employed to enable flexibility and extensibility, providing the ability to override and extend functionalities.

## Design Patterns

The project goes beyond conventional game development by integrating advanced Design Patterns. Notable patterns include:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it, useful for managing global game state.

- **Decorator Pattern**: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, enhancing the flexibility of game entities.

- **Observer Pattern**: Enables a subject to notify its observers about state changes without knowing their specific implementations, facilitating efficient event handling.

These design patterns contribute to the project's efficiency, flexibility, and extensibility. They are strategically implemented to address specific challenges within the game, providing elegant solutions to complex design problems.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to compile and run the 'Super Mario' game:

 **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MyNameIsYg/SuperMario.git
   cd super-mario-game
   ```

## To Start Playing

To start playing, add the following files:

- `opencv_world451.dll`
- `opencv_world451d.dll`

Inside the 'SeminarMario' folder. Then run the game.
